Project 3 - Word Tracker 

What the program does: An application called WordTracker that reads text files and collects and stores all the unique words it finds in those files. The BST will be able to store information from multiple text files. It will also keep track of each occurrence of a word in a file and the line on which it was found in that file. This information will be stored in a list for each word object stored in the BST. The program will also produce output, specified by the user at command line, to generate reports using a variety of iterators built into the BST
